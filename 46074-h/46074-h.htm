<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />

<small>THE RULE OF SAVOY AND BERNE</small></h2>


<p>Though Lausanne is so near Geneva, its history,
in historical times, has been widely different from
that of the neighbouring town. Geneva enjoyed a
modified independence from an early date, and
became completely independent early in the sixteenth
century. Lausanne, until nearly 300 years
later, endured the domination, first of Savoy, and
subsequently of Berne.</p>

<p>The early history is obscure and full of vexed
questions as well as unfamiliar names; but the
central fact is that the Counts of Savoy&mdash;they were
not promoted to be Dukes of Savoy until later&mdash;took
possession of the Canton of Vaud, as well as
of the Chablais and the lower Valais, after the
death of the last of the Zaeringen, at the beginning
of the thirteenth century. For the next 300 years
they exercised overlordship, limited by the charters
of the towns, and, in the case of Lausanne, by the
jurisdiction of the Bishop&mdash;a complicated state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
things which the Swiss historical societies may be
left to unravel.</p>

<p>It seems clear, however, that the Savoyards were
no hard taskmasters. 'The country of Vaud,' says
its historian, Louis Vulliemin, 'was happy and
proud to belong to them. They exacted little
from it, and accorded it their powerful protection.
The various States used to assemble at Moudon,
the central town, summoned by the Council of
Moudon, or by the Governor of Vaud, acting as
the representative of the Prince. There was no
palace. They met in an inn, or in the house of
one of the citizens of the neighbourhood. Often
they assembled in such small numbers that, for
lack of a quorum, no decision could be taken....
No burdensome or unduly progressive measures
were adopted. As a rule, the good old customs
were confirmed. When a departure from them
was resolved upon, it became law by receiving the
sanction of the Prince. The business of the herald
was to see that it was proclaimed, in the proper
places, in a loud and intelligible voice. The Prince
had sworn an oath to impose no new legislation
that was not in accordance with the will of the
nation as expressed by the estates of the realm.'</p>

<p>The most notable of the Governors was Peter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Savoy&mdash;the same Peter of Savoy whom we meet
in English history, fighting in the civil wars of
the days of Simon de Montfort. His headquarters
were in the Castle of Chillon, where he not only
dispensed justice, but also amended the criminal
law. It was the barbarous rule of the time that
an offender who had been fined for a misdemeanour
should have his nose cut off if he were unable
to pay; Peter compelled even the Bishops to
abandon that cruel custom. For the rest, to quote
Vulliemin:</p>

<p>'He received his vassals in the great hall of the
Castle, where their coats of arms hung on the wall
around that of the House of Savoy. The blowing
of a horn announced that the meal was served.
The ladies arrived in their emblazoned best. The
chaplain read the grace from a volume bound in
violet and gold&mdash;the precious depositary of Divine
law and ecclesiastical ritual. After the feast came
the hour of merry recreations. The Court fool
and the minstrels took their seats by the side of
the Prince, and the nobility thus passed their lives
in junketing.'</p>

<p>This is the same writer's picture of the lives of
the burghers:</p>

<p>'At Lausanne the three estates met in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
month of May. In 1398 they submitted to a
fresh drafting of the "Plaid général," which defined
the respective rights of bishop, canons, and
burghers. Three days were devoted to the hearing
of suits. On the fourth day the Plaid, accompanied
by elders, went the round of the streets, and
ordered the necessary repairs. All the citizens
were required to follow, carrying axes or stakes, so
as to be able to lend a hand when required. The
Bishop regaled the artificers with bread, wine, and
eggs. In return, the blacksmiths had to shoe his
horses, the saddlers to provide him with spurs and
bridles, and the coachbuilders to supply him with a
carriage. Three times a year the Seneschal passed
in front of the cobblers' shops, and touched with
his rod the pair of boots which he selected for his
lordship. In time of war the prelate's army had to
serve the Prince for a day and a night without
pay, and as much longer as they might be wanted
for wages. The Bishop's business was to ransom
prisoners, protect the citizens from all injustice,
and go to war on their behalf if necessary.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MONT BLANC FROM ABOVE MORGES</p></div>
</div>

<p>'Each district of the town had its special privileges.
The fine for assault and battery was sixty
livres in the city where the Bishop resided, sixty
sous in the lower town, and only three sous outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the walls. The Bishop could not arrest a citizen
without informing the burghers, or hold an inquest
on the body of a dead man. The citizens of the
Rue de la Bourg sat in judgment on criminals
without assessors. Whenever they heard the
summons, though they might be at the dinner-table,
glass in hand, or in their shops measuring
their cloth, they had to run off and give their opinion
on the case. In return, they were exempt from
certain taxes, had the sole right of placing hucksters'
barrows in front of their shops, of using signboards,
and of keeping inns.'</p>

<p>It was the Reformation that terminated this
primitive state of affairs. A succession of weak
Governors had allowed the hold of the Dukes
of Savoy over the country to be relaxed. It was
impossible for them to maintain their authority
when the people were indoctrinated with the new
ideas. The end came when the Duke of Savoy
threatened Geneva, and the Bernese marched
through Vaud to the rescue, captured Chillon,
delivered Bonivard, and kept the Canton for their
reward.</p>

<p>From the capture of Chillon onwards, Lausanne,
like the rest of Vaud, was a Bernese dependency.
Bernese governors (or baillis) were established in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
all the strong places, and Protestantism became the
national religion.</p>

<p>The conversion of the inhabitants was chiefly
effected by Viret, a tailor's son, from Orbe, an
excellent man, and a persuasive rather than an
eloquent speaker. In 1536, after the fashion of the
times, he, Calvin, and Farel challenged the Catholic
theologians to a great debate. The monks, recognizing
him as a formidable antagonist, had previously
tried to get rid of him by surreptitious means.
One of them had assaulted him at Payerne, and
another had attempted to poison him at Geneva.
At Lausanne they were obliged to argue with
him, and failed still more conspicuously. The
argument lasted for a week, and, at the end of the
week, the populace, considering that the Protestant
case was proved, proceeded to the cathedral to
desecrate the altars and smash the images, while
the governors confiscated the Church property and
offered it for sale. 'It was thus,' writes Vulliemin,
'that Jost de Diesbach bought the church and
vicarage of St. Christophe in order to turn the one
into a baking house and the other into a country
seat, and that Michel Augsburger transformed the
ancient church of Baulmes into a stable for his
cattle.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time a disciplinary tribunal, somewhat
on the lines of Calvin's theocracy at Geneva,
was instituted to supervise the morals of the
citizens; and absence from church was made
punishable by fine, imprisonment, or banishment.
Viret, it is true, was driven to resign his pastorate
and leave Lausanne, because he was not allowed
to refuse the Holy Communion to notorious evil-livers,
and fifty other pastors followed his example;
but the pastors who remained drafted a new moral
code of sufficient severity, consisting, in the main,
of a gloss upon each of the Ten Commandments,
giving a list of the offences which it must be understood,
for the future, to prohibit. Under the
heading of Seventh Commandment, for example,
it was written: 'This forbids fornication, drunkenness,
baptismal and burial banquets, pride, dancing,
and the use of tobacco and snuff.'</p>

<p>A number of Sumptuary Laws were also adopted,
to check the spread of luxury; and here again we
cannot do better than quote Vulliemin:</p>

<p>'The regulations prescribed the dress materials
which each class of society might wear, and permitted
none but the nobility to appear in gold-embroidered
stuffs, brocades, collars of Paris point
lace, and lace-embellished shoes. The women of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the middle classes were forbidden to wear caps
costing more than ten crowns, or any sort of
false hair, or more than one petticoat at a time.
One regulation settled the size of men's wigs, and
another determined how low a lady's bodice might
be cut. There was a continual battle between
authority and fashion, and fashion was always
contriving to evade the law. The purpose of the
magistracy was not only to maintain the privileges
of the upper classes, but also to fortify domestic
morality against the imperious demands of vanity.
A special government department was instituted to
stop the use of tobacco. The baillis alone considered
that the law did not apply to them; but one day,
when one of these officials opened his snuff-box in
church, the preacher interrupted him. "Here," he
said, "one only snuffs the Word of God." Above
all things, however, morality was the object of the
jealous care of the magistrates of Vaud. So it was
with an outburst of holy wrath that they heard
that there was at Vevey "a dancing master, a
Catholic, whose presence caused great scandals, at
balls, in the evenings, between the two sexes." The
stranger was banished, and the town was censured
for its criminal toleration.'</p>

<p>Such was the régime, and though, in externals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it resembled the régime at Geneva, there was
one very significant difference. The Genevan discipline
was self-imposed, and at least expressed the
will of a working majority of the people. The
Lausanne discipline represented the will of a conqueror
imposed upon a subject race, and the conqueror
had a rough and heavy hand, and rigorously
excluded the subject people from participation in
public affairs. The consequences can be traced in
their history, habits, and manners.</p>

<p>There was one poor feeble attempt at revolt.
A certain Major Davel, after whom one of the
steamboats on the lake is called&mdash;a Pietist, and
perhaps a religious maniac&mdash;a soldier of fortune,
whose merits had attracted the attention of such
good judges as the Duke of Marlborough and
Prince Eugène, mustered the militia of Cully and
marched into Lausanne, declaring that he had come
to set the Canton free. Asked for explanations,
he replied that he had been guided by direct
inspiration from on high. The defence did not
save him, and he perished on the scaffold in 1723.
The revolution at which he aimed was not to be
accomplished for another eighty years, and the
event constitutes almost the whole of the political
history of Lausanne during the period under review.</p>

<small>EMIGRANTS AND IMMIGRANTS</small></h2>


<p>Forbidden to seek careers at home, most of the
aristocracy of Vaud went abroad to pursue fortune
in the service of some foreign Power. There was
always a good opening for them, whether as mercenary
soldiers or as instructors of the young, and
many of them achieved distinction and rose to high
positions. Haldimand of Yverdon became a Lieutenant-General
in the British Army and Governor
of Canada. Réverdil of Nyon was first tutor to
Christian VII. of Denmark, and afterwards his
secretary. Amédée de Laharpe was one of Napoleon's
generals; the only General, it is said, in the
Army of Italy, who was not guilty of rapacity and
extortion. Frédéric César de Laharpe held high
office under Alexander I. of Russia; Dupuget of
Yverdon was the tutor of the Russian Grand
Dukes Nicolas and Michael; J. J. Cart was with
Admiral Hood in America; Glayre became Polish
Minister at St. Petersburg; Pache became Mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of Paris; the list could be almost indefinitely
extended.</p>

<p>Most of these emigrants, moreover, suffered from
the nostalgia which is characteristic of the Swiss.
It was not enough for them to come home to die;
they liked to return in middle age, and spend at
home the money which they had earned abroad.
And when they did return, they had, of course, no
longer the homely wits of the home-keeping youths.
They were men of experience, men of the world,
men of polished manners and cosmopolitan culture.
Their presence gave a new and a broader tone to
Lausanne society. They were not to be driven to
church like a flock of sheep, or forbidden to go
to the theatre like a pack of schoolboys, or stood
in the pillory for playing cards, or told by the
preachers what they should eat or wherewithal they
should be clothed. So far as they were concerned
the discipline of the Consistory broke down, and
the Sumptuary Laws did not apply to them. Their
example liberalized even the clergy. They insisted
upon making Lausanne a pleasant place to live in.
Strangers found out that it was pleasant, and came
to settle there in large numbers. There was already
a foreign colony in Lausanne from quite an early
date in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Geneva had had its foreign colonists from a still
earlier date, but they were exiles&mdash;Miles Coverdale,
Bishop of Exeter, John Knox, John Bodley,
William Whittingham, and others, who fled abroad
to escape persecution by the Bloody Mary. With
one accord they thanked their hosts for the hospitality
bestowed upon them, and departed as soon as
the accession of Elizabeth made it safe for them to
do so. Some of the foreigners at Lausanne were
also exiles, it is true, but hardly for conscience'
sake, the opinions which had got them into trouble
being more often political than religious. But they
selected Lausanne as their place of residence because
they liked it&mdash;not because it was a 'perfect
school of Christ,' but because the site and the
society were agreeable.</p>

<p>Voltaire himself lived there for a little while
before he settled down at Ferney, and encountered
no theological objection to the theatrical performances
which he organized. Gibbon, who was there
at the time, living in the house of Pastor Pavilliard,
declared that the entertainments, to which he was
sometimes invited, 'refined in a visible degree the
manners of Lausanne';<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the philosopher himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>paid a tribute to those manners in a letter to
D'Alembert, in which he wrote: 'All the amenities
of society and sound philosophy have found their
way into the part of Switzerland in which the
climate is most agreeable and wealth abounds.
The people here have succeeded in grafting the
politeness of Athens upon the simplicity of Sparta.'</p>

<small>GIBBON</small></h2>


<p>Voltaire belongs to Geneva rather than to Lausanne.
The most distinguished of the strangers
upon whom Lausanne has an exclusive claim is
Gibbon.</p>

<p>He was sent there, in the first instance, as a
punishment for having embraced the Roman
Catholic faith, and was lodged in the house of
M. Pavilliard, a Calvinistic minister, whose instructions
were to educate his pupil if possible, but
to convert him at all costs. The desired conversion
was effected, though it was more thorough than had
been intended. Gibbon was persuaded to receive
the Sacrament from a Protestant pastor, but never
troubled himself with religion afterwards except in
the capacity of historian. But, though he was at
first treated like a schoolboy, and consoled himself
for the loss of his liberty by getting drunk, he soon
fell in love with the town&mdash;'Fanny Lausanne,' as
he called it in a letter&mdash;and also fell in love with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Mademoiselle Suzanne Curchod. That is one of
the most famous of all literary love-stories, and one
may properly pause here to relate it at length.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Curchod was the daughter of a
country clergyman&mdash;very well educated, very
beautiful, and very generally admired. Her earliest
admirers were, naturally, the rising young ministers
of the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It amused her to invite them to
sign documents, composed in playful imitation of
legal contracts, binding themselves 'to come and
preach at Crassier as often as she required, without
waiting to be solicited, pressed, or entreated, seeing
that the greatest of their pleasures was to oblige
her on every possible occasion.' Her female friends,
hearing of this, wrote to her expressing their disapproval,
and strongly advising her to turn the
preachers out of the house as soon as they had
finished their sermons; but there is no evidence
that she acted on their advice.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE SPIRES OF ST. FRANÇOIS,

</div>

<p>Visiting Lausanne, she extended the circle of her
admirers. Her bright intelligence enabled her to
shine as a member of a certain Société du Printemps,
and also of a certain Académie des Eaux&mdash;a debating
club given to the discussion of such problems as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>'Does an element of mystery really make love more
agreeable?' or 'Can there be friendship between a
man and a woman in the same sense as between
two women or two men?' Her conduct in this
connection was such that her friends warned her
that her desire to make herself agreeable to young
men was too clearly advertised; but it does not
appear that the warning made any impression on
her. At all events, she was very successful in
making herself agreeable to Gibbon, then a lad
about eighteen years of age. 'Saw Mademoiselle
Curchod. Omnia vincit amor, et nos cedamus
amori,' is one of the early entries in his diary; and
we have a picture of Gibbon, at about the same
date, from Mademoiselle Curchod's own pen. In
middle age&mdash;as we can see from his portraits&mdash;he
was an ugly, ungainly, podgy little man; but it
is not thus that he appears in the portrait drawn
by the woman who loved him.</p>

<p>'He has beautiful hair,' Mademoiselle Curchod
writes, 'a pretty hand, and the air of a man of
rank. His face is so intellectual and strange that
I know no one like him. It has so much expression
that one is always finding something new
in it. His gestures are so appropriate that they
add much to his speech. In a word, he has one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of those extraordinary faces that one never tires
of trying to depict. He knows the respect that
is due to women. His courtesy is easy without
verging on familiarity. He dances moderately
well.'</p>

<p>So these two naturally&mdash;and rightly and properly&mdash;fell
in love; they must have seemed each other's
ideal complements, if ever lovers were. But they
were not to marry. The story of their attachment,
their separation, and their subsequent Platonic
friendship is one of the romances of literature.
Gibbon himself has told the story in one of the
most frequently quoted passages of his autobiography.
His version of it is inexact and misleading;
but it must be quoted, if only in order that
it may be criticized:</p>

<p>'I need not blush,' he writes, 'at recollecting the
object of my choice; and though my love was disappointed
of success, I am rather proud that I was
once capable of feeling such a pure and exalted
sentiment. The personal attractions of Mademoiselle
Susan Curchod were embellished by the
virtues and talents of the mind. Her fortune was
humble, but her family was respectable. Her
mother, a native of France, had preferred her
religion to her country. The profession of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
father did not extinguish the moderation and
philosophy of his temper, and he lived content with
a small salary and laborious duty in the obscure
lot of minister of Crassy, in the mountains that
separate the Pays de Vaud from the county of
Burgundy. In the solitude of a sequestered village
he bestowed a liberal, and even learned, education
on his only daughter. She surpassed his hopes by
her proficiency in the sciences and languages; and
in her short visits to some relations at Lausanne,
the wit, the beauty, and erudition of Mademoiselle
Curchod were the theme of universal applause. The
report of such a prodigy awakened my curiosity;
I saw and loved. I found her learned without
pedantry, lively in conversation, pure in sentiment,
and elegant in manners; and the first sudden
emotion was fortified by the habits and knowledge
of a more familiar acquaintance. She permitted
me to make two or three visits at her father's house.
I passed some happy days there, in the mountains
of Burgundy, and her parents honourably encouraged
the connection. In a calm retirement the gay
vanity of youth no longer fluttered in her bosom,
and I might presume to hope that I had made
some impression on a virtuous heart. At Crassy
and Lausanne I indulged my dream of felicity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but on my return to England I soon discovered
that my father would not hear of this strange
alliance, and that, without his consent, I was myself
destitute and helpless. After a painful struggle
I yielded to my fate; I sighed as a lover, I
obeyed as a son; my wound was insensibly healed
by time, absence, and the habits of a new life. My
cure was accelerated by a faithful report of the
tranquillity and cheerfulness of the lady herself,
and my love subsided in friendship and esteem.'</p>

<p>Such is Gibbon's story, which is also the accepted
story. It is, perhaps, a palliation of its inaccuracies
that, at the time when he wrote it down, he and
Mademoiselle Curchod&mdash;then Madame Necker&mdash;were
on such pleasant terms of friendship that
neither of them cared to remember or be reminded
that either had ever treated the other badly. We
shall come to that matter presently; here it is
proper that the inaccuracies should be noted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steps by which Joseph Buonaparte

</div>

<p>Gibbon's story, it will be observed, gives us the
impression that, on getting home, he lost no time
in opening his heart to his father, and, having
done this, lost no further time in acquainting
Mademoiselle Curchod with his father's views.
M. d'Haussonville tells us that he left Lausanne
in 1758, kept Mademoiselle Curchod waiting four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
years for a letter,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and then in 1762 sat down and
wrote, breaking off the engagement. One shrinks
from the attempt to picture the feelings of the poor
girl who, after enduring suspense, and trying to
frame excuses for silence, broke the seal of the
long-expected missive, only to read:</p>

<p>'I do not know how to begin this letter. Yet
begin it I must. I take up my pen, I drop it, I
resume it. This commencement shows you what
it is that I am about to say. Spare me the rest.
Yes, Mademoiselle, I must renounce you for ever.
The sentence is passed; my heart laments it; but,
in the presence of my duty, every other consideration
must be silent....</p>

<p>'My father spoke of the cruelty of deserting him,
and of sending him prematurely to his grave, of
the cowardice of trampling underfoot my duty to
my country. I withdrew to my room and remained
there for two hours. I will not attempt to picture
to you my state of mind. But I left my room to
tell my father that I agreed to sacrifice to him the
happiness of my life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>'Mademoiselle, may you be happier than I can
ever hope to be! This will always be my prayer;
this will even be my consolation.... Assure
M. and Madame Curchod of my respect, my
esteem, and my regrets. Good-bye. I shall
always remember Mademoiselle Curchod as the
most worthy, the most charming, of women. May
she not entirely forget a man who does not deserve
the despair to which he is a prey.'</p>

<p>Even this, however, was not the end of the
story, though one would think it was if one had
only Gibbon's narrative to go by. In 1763 he
revisited Lausanne, and his own story of his
sojourn does not so much as mention Mademoiselle
Curchod's name. One would gather from it either
that he did not see her, or that love had already on
both sides 'subsided in friendship and esteem.'
But when the Vicomte d'Haussonville was given
access to the archives of the Necker family, he
found letters proving that this was not by any
means the case.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Curchod's father was then dead,
and she was living at Geneva, supporting her
mother by teaching. Some of her friends&mdash;notably
Pastor Moultou&mdash;tried to bring Gibbon to a sense
of the obligations which they felt he owed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
her. Rousseau was brought into the business,
and expressed an opinion which led Gibbon to
retort, 'That extraordinary man, whom I admire
and pity, should have been less precipitate in condemning
the moral character and conduct of a
stranger.' It is useless, however, to try to piece
the whole story together&mdash;the materials are inadequate.
One can only take the letters which the
Vicomte d'Haussonville has published, and which,
as he points out, are by no means the whole of the
correspondence, and see what sidelights they throw
upon it.</p>

<p>First we have one of Mademoiselle Curchod's
letters. Whether she wrote it because she had
met Gibbon and found his manner towards her
changed, or was perplexed and troubled because he
had not sought a meeting, we have no means of
knowing. But it is quite clear that she wrote it
under the sense of having been treated badly.</p>

<p>'For five years,' she writes, 'I have, by my
unique and, indeed, inconceivable behaviour, done
sacrifice to this chimera. At last my heart,
romantic as it is, has been convinced of my mistake.
I ask you, on my knees, to dissuade me
from my madness in loving you. Subscribe the
full confession of your indifference, and my soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
will adapt itself to the changed conditions; certainty
will bring me the tranquillity for which I
sigh. You will be the most contemptible of men
if you refuse to be frank with me. God will
punish you, in spite of my prayers, if there is the
least hypocrisy in your reply.'</p>

<p>The reply is lost. Mademoiselle Curchod
presumably destroyed it because it pained her.
Apparently it contained a proposal of Platonic
friendship as a substitute for love. At all events,
Mademoiselle Curchod's answer seems to accept
that situation, whether with ulterior designs or not,
for it begins:</p>

<p>'What is fortune to me? Besides, it is not to
you that I have sacrificed it, but to an imaginary
being which will never exist elsewhere than in a
silly, romantic head like mine. From the moment
when your letter disillusioned me, you resumed
your place, in my eyes, on the same footing as
other men; and, after being the only man whom I
could love, you have become one of those to whom
I feel the least drawn, because you are the one
that bears the least resemblance to my chimerical
ideal.... Follow out the plan that you propose,
place your attachment for me on the same footing
as that of my other friends, and you will find me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as confiding, as tender, and, at the same time, as
indifferent as I am to them.'</p>

<p>And the writer proceeds to take up the Platonic
position at once, to criticize Gibbon's first essay in
literature, to offer him useful introductions, and
to ask him to advise her whether she would be
likely to be well treated if she took a situation as
'lady companion' in England.</p>

<p>Even in this Platonic correspondence, however,
Gibbon, with a prudence beyond his years, seems
to have scented danger.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle,' he wrote, 'must you be for ever
pressing upon me a happiness which sound reason
compels me to decline? I have forfeited your love.
Your friendship is left to me, and it bestows so
much honour upon me that I cannot hesitate. I
accept it, mademoiselle, as a precious offering in
exchange for my own friendship, which is already
yours, and as a blessing of which I know the value
too well to be disposed to lose it.</p>

<p>'But this correspondence, mademoiselle, I am
sensible of the pleasures which it brings me, but, at
the same time, I am conscious of its dangers. I
feel the dangers that it has for me; I fear the
dangers that it may have for both of us. Permit
me to avoid those dangers by my silence. Forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
my fears, mademoiselle; they have their origin
in my esteem for you.'</p>

<p>And he proceeded to answer her questions concerning
the position and prospects of 'lady companions'
in England, expecting, no doubt, that he
would hear no more from her.</p>

<p>Even then, however, the story was not ended.
The most passionate of Mademoiselle Curchod's
letters bears a later date. It is the letter of a
woman who feels that she has been treated shamefully.
If it were not that Mademoiselle Curchod
made a happy marriage so very soon afterwards, one
would also say that it was the letter of a woman
whose heart was broken. One gathers from it that,
while Mademoiselle Curchod appreciated Gibbon's
difficulty in marrying her while he was dependent
upon his father, she was willing to wait for him
until his father's death should leave him free to
follow the impulse of his heart. In the meantime
she reproaches him for having caused her to reject
other offers of marriage, and protests that it is not
true, whatever calumnious gossips may have said,
that, in Gibbon's absence, she has flirted with other
men. Above all, she protests that she has not
flirted with Gibbon's great friend, M. Deyverdun.
Her last words are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I am treating you as an honest man of the
world, who is incapable of breaking his promise, of
seduction, or of treachery, but who has, instead of
that, amused himself in racking my heart with
tortures, well prepared, and well carried into effect.
I will not threaten you, therefore, with the wrath
of heaven&mdash;the expression that escaped from me in
my first emotion. But I assure you, without laying
any claim to the gift of prophecy, that you will one
day regret the irreparable loss that you have
incurred in alienating for ever the too frank and
tender heart of</p>

<p class="signature">
'S. C.'<br />
</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p>LAUSANNE, LOOKING EAST</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rest is silence; and the presumption is
strong that these were actually the last words
which sealed the estrangement. If it were not
for Mademoiselle Curchod's subsequent attitude
towards him, one would be bound to say that
Gibbon behaved abominably. But, as we shall
see presently, her resentment was not enduring.
Perhaps she was aware of extenuating circumstances
that we do not know of. Perhaps, in her heart of
hearts, she was conscious of having spread her net
to catch a husband who then seemed a very brilliant
match to the daughter of the country clergyman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
The letter of the friend who begged her not to
advertise so clearly her desire to make herself
agreeable to men would certainly lend some colour
to the suggestion. At any rate, since she herself
forgave Gibbon, it seems unfair for anyone else to
press the case against him.</p>

<p>It was nearly twenty years later&mdash;in 1783&mdash;that
Gibbon decided to make Lausanne his home.</p>

<p>A good deal of water had flowed under the bridge
in the meantime. He had written, and published,
half of his History; and that half had sufficed to
make him famous. He had been an officer in the
militia and a Member of Parliament. He had been
a constant figure in fashionable society, and an
occasional figure in literary society; a fellow-member
with Charles James Fox of Boodle's,
White's, and Brooks's; a fellow-member of the
Literary Club with Johnson, Burke, Adam Smith,
Oliver Goldsmith, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Sir
Joseph Banks. He had held office in the department
of the Board of Trade, and lost it at the time
of the coalition between Fox and North. His
applications for employment in the Diplomatic
Service&mdash;whether as Secretary to the Embassy at
Paris or as Minister Plenipotentiary at Berne&mdash;had
been politely rejected. And he had become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
middle-aged bachelor whose income, unless supplemented
by the emoluments of some public office,
hardly sufficed for the demands of his social
position.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it occurred to him to
propose to his friend, M. Deyverdun&mdash;the same
M. Deyverdun with whom Mademoiselle Curchod
vowed that she had never flirted&mdash;that they should
keep house together at Lausanne. M. Deyverdun,
who was like himself a confirmed bachelor of
moderate means, and had a larger house than he
wanted, was delighted with the proposal. All
Gibbon's friends and relatives told him that he was
making a fool of himself; but he knew better. He
sold all his property, except his library, and 'bade
a long farewell to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fumum et opes strepitumque
Romæ</i>.' His first winter, as he puts it in his
delightful style, 'was given to a general embrace
without nice discrimination of persons and characters.'
The comprehensive embrace completed,
he settled down to work.</p>

<p>His life at Lausanne is faithfully mirrored in his
letters, more particularly in his letters to Lord
Sheffield. It was at once a luxurious and an industrious
life. One fact which stands out clearly is
that Gibbon took no exercise. He boasts that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a period of five years, he never moved five miles
from Lausanne; he apologizes for a corpulence
which makes it absolutely impossible for him to
cross the Great Saint Bernard; he admits that, when
he entertained Mr. Fox, he did not go for walks
with that statesman, but hired a guide to do so on
his behalf. He also drank a great deal of Madeira
and Malvoisie. His letters to Lord Sheffield are
full of appeals for pipes of these exhilarating
beverages. He declares that they are necessary for
the preservation of his health, and appears to have
persuaded himself that they were good for gout.
The consequence was that he had several severe
attacks of that distressing malady.</p>

<p>Gout or no gout, however, he freely enjoyed the
relaxation of social intercourse. He was never
tired of pointing out to his correspondents that,
whereas in London he was nobody in particular, in
Lausanne he was a leader of society. His position
there was, in fact, similar in many ways to that
of Voltaire at Geneva; though he differed from
Voltaire in always keeping on good terms with
all his neighbours. To be invited to his parties
was no less a mark of distinction than it had been,
a generation earlier, to be invited to the philosopher's
parties at Ferney. One of the letters tells us how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he gave a ball, and stole away to bed at 2 a.m.,
leaving the young people, his guests, to keep it up
till after sunrise. He also gave frequent dinners,
and still more frequent card-parties. When the
gout was very bad, he gave card-parties in his bedroom.</p>

<p>Distinguished strangers often came to see him,
and gave Lausanne the tone of a fashionable resort.
'You talk of Lausanne,' he writes, 'as a place of
retirement, yet, from the situation and freedom of
the Pays de Vaud, all nations, and all extraordinary
characters are astonished to meet each other.
The Abbé Raynal, the great Gibbon, and Mercier,
author of the "Tableau de Paris," have been in the
same room. The other day the Prince and Princesse
de Ligne, the Duke and Duchess d'Ursel, etc.,
came from Brussels on purpose to act a comedy.'
And again: 'A few weeks ago, as I was walking
on our terrace with M. Tissot, the celebrated
physician; M. Mercier, the author of the "Tableau
de Paris"; the Abbé Raynal; Monsieur, Madame,
and Mademoiselle Necker; the Abbé de Bourbon,
a natural son of Lewis the Fifteenth; the Hereditary
Prince of Brunswick, Prince Henry of Prussia,
and a dozen Counts, Barons, and extraordinary
persons,' etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>From time to time he faced the question whether
it would be well to marry. Madame Necker dissuaded
him from the adventure on the ground that
in order to marry happily it is necessary to marry
young. It is not certain that her advice was disinterested,
but it was good advice to give to a man
who, after expressing his readiness to adopt 'some
expedient, even the most desperate, to secure the
domestic society of a female companion,' summed
up his sentiments upon the subject in this candid
language:</p>

<p>'I am not in love with any of the hyænas of
Lausanne, though there are some who keep their
claws tolerably well pared. Sometimes, in a solitary
mood, I have fancied myself married to one or
another of those whose society and conversation
are the most pleasing to me; but when I have
painted in my fancy all the probable consequences
of such a union, I have started from my dream,
rejoiced in my escape, and ejaculated a thanksgiving
that I was still in possession of my natural
freedom.'</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE MARKET-PLACE, LAUSANNE</p></div>
</div>

<p>This, however, was not written until after the
History was finished. Gibbon never felt the need
of a female companion so long as he had his work
to occupy him. The fact that he began to feel it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
acutely as soon as ever the work was done gives an
added pathos to this, the most famous and the most
frequently quoted passage of his memoirs:</p>

<p>'I have presumed to mark the moment of conception:
I shall now commemorate the hour of
my final deliverance. It was on the day, or rather
night, of the 27th of June, 1787, between the hours
of eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last lines
of the last page, in a summer-house in my garden.
After laying down my pen, I took several turns
in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berceau</i>, or covered walk of acacias, which commands
a prospect of the country, the lake, and the
mountains. The air was temperate, the sky was
serene, the silver orb of the moon was reflected
from the waters, and all Nature was silent. I will
not dissemble the first emotions on the recovery of
my freedom, and, perhaps, the establishment of
my fame. But my pride was soon humbled, and a
sober melancholy was spread over my mind by the
idea that I had taken an everlasting leave of an old
and agreeable companion, and that whatsoever
might be the future fate of my History, the life of
the historian must be short and precarious.'</p>

<p>The life of the historian was, in fact, destined to
last only for another six years&mdash;years in which he
sometimes was desperately anxious to relieve his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
loneliness, aggravated by the death of Deyverdun,
by seeking 'the domestic society of a female companion,'
but inclined, on the whole, to the opinion
encouraged by Madame Necker, that the remedy
would be worse than the disease. We probably
shall not be wrong in conjecturing that the pleasure
which he derived from Madame Necker's correspondence
and society assisted him in coming to
this decision. At any rate, we must admit that
there are few literary romances more remarkable
than this story, of the renewal of love some thirty
years or so after a lovers' quarrel.</p>

<p>The lovers parted, as we have seen, with high-strung
feelings&mdash;at least upon the lady's side. They
met again soon after Mademoiselle Curchod had
accepted the heart and hand of Jacques Necker,
the rich Parisian banker, destined to become
Louis XVI.'s Minister of Finance. Gibbon, coming
to Paris, called, and was well received. We have
accounts of the visit from both of them. Madame
Necker says that her vanity was flattered because
Gibbon appeared to be dazzled by the contemplation
of her wealth. Gibbon complains that he was
not taken very seriously, that M. Necker invited
him to supper every evening, and went to bed,
leaving him alone with his wife. The philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Balzac would have called him a fool, and classed
him with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prédestinés</i>; but it does not appear
that scandal, or occasion for scandal, or anything
worse than the interchange of sentimental <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">persiflage</i>,
resulted.</p>

<p>A gap in the history of their friendship follows,
but in 1776 we find the Neckers visiting Gibbon in
Bentinck Street. Gibbon writes patronizingly of
the husband as 'a sensible, good-natured creature,'
and of the wife he says: 'I live with her just as I
used to do twenty years ago, laugh at her Paris
varnish, and oblige her to become a simple, reasonable
Suissesse.'</p>

<p>We need not interpret this statement <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au pied de
la lettre</i>, but the visit certainly marks a stage in the
story of their intimacy. Gibbon went to see the
Neckers in Paris in the following year, and after
his return to London Madame du Deffand told
him how she had talked to Madame Necker about
him. 'We talked of M. Gibbon. Of what else?
Of M. Gibbon&mdash;continually of M. Gibbon.' And
Madame Necker herself wrote, at about the same
time, with reference to the publication of the first
volumes of 'The Decline and Fall':</p>

<p>'Wherever I go your books shall follow me, and
give me pleasure and happiness. If you write, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
your letters will be welcome and appreciated. If
you do not write ... but I refuse to contemplate
this painful possibility.'</p>

<p>Gibbon's migration to Lausanne and the Neckers'
purchase of their famous country seat at Coppet
united them by still closer ties, and one cannot
help noticing that at this period of their lives&mdash;when
they were both something over fifty years of
age&mdash;Madame Necker's letters to Gibbon became
at once more frequent and more affectionate.
Some of those letters, indeed, can only be distinguished
from love-letters by reading into them our
knowledge of Madame Necker's reputation for
propriety. We have seen her dissuading Gibbon
from marriage on the ground that to marry late is
to marry unhappily. Another reason which she
gives is that 'without a miracle it would be impossible
to find a woman worthy of you.' Of a contemplated
visit to Lausanne she says: 'I am looking
forward with a delightful sentiment to the day I
am to pass with you.' And afterwards:</p>

<p>'Returning here, and finding only the tombs of
those I loved so well, I found you, as it were, a
solitary tree whose shade still covers the desert
which separates me from the first years of my
life.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>And in another letter, more sentimental still, we
read:</p>

<p>'Come back to us when you are free. The
moment of your leisure ought always to belong to
her who has been <i>your first love and your last</i>. I
cannot make up my mind which of these titles is
the sweeter and the dearer to my heart.'</p>

<p>What are we to make of it all? Nothing,
assuredly, that entitles us to cast a stone at
Madame Necker, or to express for her husband a
pity which he never felt for himself. Yet one
imagines that after M. Necker, who kept such early
hours, had retired to his well-earned repose, there
must sometimes have been certain sentimental
communings, in which the old note of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">persiflage</i>
was no longer to be heard. One listens in fancy to
the regrets of these two who never forgot that they
had once been lovers&mdash;regrets, no doubt, not openly
expressed, but only coyly hinted&mdash;for the things
that might have been.</p>

<p>The regrets, we may take it, were tempered by
the lurking consciousness that things were really
better as they were. The lovers must have known
that, if they had married on nothing a year, the
one would never have written his history and the
other would never have had her salon, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
would have been two struggling nonentities whom
the world would never have heard of. They must
have felt, too, that the success in life which they
had achieved separately, but could not possibly
have achieved together, had meant much to them:
that in winning it they had fulfilled their destinies;
that their tempers would have soured if they had
had to live without it. All this they must have
admitted to themselves, and even in their most
candid moments, to each other. And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<small>MADAME DE MONTOLIEU&mdash;DR. TISSOT</small></h2>


<p>To us, as we look backwards, Gibbon in Lausanne
society figures as a Triton among the minnows,
but to his contemporaries he probably seemed
less important. He certainly did to his contemporaries
in London. Boswell, as we all know, considered
him the intellectual inferior of Dr. Johnson;
and there is the story of the Duke of St. Albans
accepting a presentation copy of his 'Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire' with the genial remark,
'Hallo! Another two d&mdash;&mdash;d thick volumes!
Always scribble, scribble, scribble, eh, Mr. Gibbon!'
No one in Lausanne took quite such a Philistine
tone as that, but it is doubtful whether even
Lausanne would have voted him a higher position
than that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primus inter pares</i>. Lausanne,
after all, had its native notables, and was too
near to its celebrities to see them in their true
perspective. It had, among others, Madame de
Montolieu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a beauty as well as a woman of letters,
and Gibbon himself admired her in both capacities.
He wrote to Lord Sheffield that there was 'danger'
for him, and he was in danger of making himself
ridiculous if of nothing worse. The story is told
that he fell upon his knees to make a declaration of
love to Madame Montolieu, and being too fat to
rise without assistance, had to be helped to his feet
by a domestic servant summoned for the purpose.
He bore no malice, however, but even persuaded
the lady to publish a novel which she had written
'to amuse an aged relative,' offering, when she
objected, to attest his belief in its merits by printing
it under his own signature.</p>

<p>The novel in question was 'Caroline de Lichtfield,'
which has passed through many editions&mdash;the first
in 1786 and the last in 1846&mdash;and been translated
into English. Its enthusiastic reception launched
its author upon a career. Her collected works, including
a French translation of 'The Swiss Family
Robinson,' fill 105 volumes; and a host of imitators
arose. 'Well! are they still turning out novels at
Lausanne?' was one of the questions that Napoleon
asked the Council of the Helvetian Republic; and
Louis Bridel, brother of the more famous Doyen
Bridel, writing in 1787, drew a graphic picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the Lausanne ladies, all with one accord engaged
in literary toil:</p>

<p>'The romance of "Caroline," and the renown
which it has brought its author, has caused such a
ferment in our feminine heads that, jealous of the
reputation of one of their number, they cover an
incredible quantity of paper with ink. They pass
their days in writing novels; their toilette tables
are no longer covered with chiffons, but with sheets
of notepaper; and, if one unfolds a curlpaper, one
is sure to find that it is a fragment of a love-letter,
or of a romantic description.'</p>

<p>Madame de Charrière, a rival craftswoman of
whom we shall have to speak, the author of
'Lettres de Lausanne,' did not like Madame de
Montolieu. She called her a 'provincial coquette,'
and ridiculed her 'pretentions,' maintaining that,
though her countrymen were attracted by her
charms, 'the English who boarded with her stepfather
considered her a disgustingly dirty and
untidy person.' But Gibbon, who was not only
English but a man of taste, thought otherwise, as
we have seen; and his judgment may be accepted
as the less prejudiced of the two. And Madame
de Montolieu's literary success, at any rate, is not
to be disputed. She lived to be an octogenarian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and retained her popularity until the last.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> She
and her only child, dying simultaneously, were
buried in the same grave, on which may be read the
inscription, 'Here I am, O Lord, with the son
whom Thou hast given me!'</p>

<p>Dr. Tissot, whom we have already met on the
Terrace at Lausanne, is another celebrity of the
period who merits further mention. He and
Gibbon once danced a minuet together at an evening
party&mdash;a penalty imposed upon them in a game
of 'forfeits.' They thus, says Tissot's German
biographer, Eynard, 'revived the innocent pleasures
of Arcadia of old'; but the great physician, is
less famous for the way in which he took his
pleasures than for the way in which he did his
work. Tronchin of Geneva had been the medical
attendant of the cosmopolitan aristocracy, had
anticipated Rousseau in exhorting mothers to
nurse their own children, and had ventured, with
a rude hand, to open the windows of the Palace of
Versailles. Tissot of Lausanne aspired to be the
medical adviser of the common people. 'While,'
he wrote, 'we are attending the most brilliant
portion of humanity in the cities, the most useful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>members of society are perishing miserably in the
country villages.'</p>

<p>Obviously, he could not do much personally to
cure the ailments of a scattered rural population;
but he did what he might to help them by writing
popular manuals of hygiene. Some of his advice is
not even now out of date. He denounced the vice
of overfeeding the delicate: 'The more one loves
an invalid, the more one tries to make him eat; and
that is to kill him with kindness.' He also spoke
vigorous words against excessive tea-drinking:</p>

<p>'These teapots full of hot water which I find on
people's tables remind me of the box of Pandora
from which all evils issued&mdash;but with this difference,
that they do not even leave hope behind, but, being
a cause of hypochondria, disseminate melancholy
and despair.'</p>

<p>These excellent pamphlets brought Tissot fame
and the friendship of the great. Joseph II. offered
him a medical chair at the University of Padua,
which he occupied for two years. He was offered,
but did not accept, the posts of physician at the
Courts of Hanover and Poland. The Prince of
Wurtemberg&mdash;he whom Rousseau addressed in the
famous letter beginning 'If I had had the misfortune
to be born a Prince'&mdash;settled at Lausanne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in order to be near him; and many interesting
people sought his advice by correspondence. In
particular a certain young gunner wrote from
Ajaccio to ask what his uncle, an Archdeacon, had
better take for the gout. The orthography is
curious: '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">S'il asseie de remuer les genoux, des
douleurs égus lui font cesser son accion.</span>' The
signature is '<span class="smcap">Buonaparte</span>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Officier au régiment de

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<small>BENJAMIN CONSTANT AND MADAME DE STAËL</small></h2>


<p>Next, though they do not become interesting
until a somewhat later date, we may mention the
Constants: Rosalie de Constant, the witty little
hunchback whose sentimental correspondence with
Bernardin de Saint-Pierre has recently been
published, and her more famous cousin, Benjamin
Constant de Rebecque, the story of whose love for
Madame de Staël has recently been revived.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> That
is another story which will be here in its proper
place.</p>

<p>Benjamin was a man of many love-affairs;
'Constant the inconstant' was the name that women
called him by. He was the son of a Swiss soldier
of fortune, and had a cosmopolitan education at
Oxford and Edinburgh, in Belgium and in Germany.
In his youth he held the post of Chamberlain at
the Court of Brunswick, where he acquired distingished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>manners. He was brilliant, though
shallow, and there was something Wertheresque
about him.</p>

<p>Born in 1767, he was married, in 1789, to the
ugliest of the Duchess of Brunswick's maids of
honour. He said afterwards that he had married
her for no particular reason that he could remember,
but that his reasons for divorcing her were clear
enough. After his separation from her, he consoled
himself by an intrigue with Madame de Charrière&mdash;a
Dutch lady, married to a Switzer, residing at
Colombier, near Neuchâtel, and known as the
authoress of several sentimental novels. It was an
affair that could hardly have lasted long in any
case, seeing that the lady was twenty-seven years
older than her lover. As a matter of fact it came to
a quick end when the lover met Madame de Staël.</p>

<p>The details of that meeting are curious.
Being at Lausanne, Benjamin Constant set out
to call on Madame de Staël at Coppet. His
relatives already knew, and he was interested
to make her acquaintance. It happened that he
met Madame de Staël on the road, driving from
Coppet to Lausanne. He stopped the carriage and
introduced himself. She invited him to get in, and
drove him back. Finding his company agreeable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
she pressed him to stay to supper with her. He
did so, and was farther rewarded by an invitation
to breakfast with his hostess on the following
morning.</p>

<p>It was to Madame de Charrière herself that
Benjamin Constant first confided the impression
that Madame de Staël had made upon him.</p>

<p>'It is the most interesting acquaintance that I
have ever made,' he wrote. 'Seldom have I seen
such a combination of alluring and dazzling qualities,
such brilliance, and such good sense, a friendliness
so expansive and so cultivated, such generosity
of sentiment, and such gentle courtesy. She is the
second woman I have met for whom I could have
counted the world well lost&mdash;you know who was
the first. She is, in fact, a being apart&mdash;a superior
being, such as one meets but once in a century.'</p>

<p>Having read that, Madame de Charrière knew
that she had passed for ever out of Benjamin Constant's
life. His own writings give us a glimpse of
the early days of the new intimacy. Two passages
from his diary, the second supplementing the first,
supply the picture. Thus we read, on one day:</p>

<p>'I had agreed with Madame de Staël that, in
order to avoid compromising her, I should never
stay with her later than midnight. Whatever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
charm of her conversation, and however passionate
my desire for something more than her conversation,
I had to submit to this rule. But this evening,
the time having passed more quickly than
usual, I pulled out my watch to demonstrate that
it was not yet time for me to go. But the inexorable
minute-hand having deceived me, in a moment
of childish anger I flung the instrument of my
condemnation on the floor and broke it. "How
silly you are!" Madame de Staël exclaimed. But
what a smile I perceived shining through her reproaches!
Decidedly my broken watch will do
me a good turn.'</p>

<p>And the next day we find the entry:</p>

<p>'I have not bought myself a new watch. I do
not need one any more.'</p>

<p>For a time the affair proceeded satisfactorily,
no serious cloud appearing on the horizon until the
death of M. de Staël. Then, of course, Madame
de Staël was free to marry her lover, and Benjamin
Constant proposed that she should do so. But she
would not. One reason was that she did not wish
to change a name that her writings had made
famous; another, and perhaps a weightier one, that,
though she loved Benjamin, she had no confidence
in him&mdash;'Constant the inconstant' was inconstant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
still. Though he loved Madame de Staël, he loved
other women too. His intimacy with Madame
Talma, the actor's wife, was notorious, and was not
the only intimacy of the kind with which rumour
credited him. Altogether, he was not the sort of
man whom any woman could marry with any
certainty that he would make her happy.</p>

<p>So Madame de Staël refused to marry Benjamin
Constant, and with her refusal their relations
entered upon a fresh and interesting phase. Henceforward
the story is one of subsiding passion on his
part, and very desperate efforts on hers to fan the
dying embers of his desire. Again and again he
tried to break with her; again and again she overwhelmed
him with her reproaches, and brought him
back, a penitent slave, suing for the renewal of her
favour. The time when these things happened
was the time when her salon at Coppet was at the
zenith of its renown. The story is told for us by
Benjamin Constant himself, in his 'Journal Intime,'
a diary not written for publication, but published,
long after his death, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue Internationale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in 1887.</p>

<p>The tone, at first, is that of a man whom
lassitude has overtaken after elegant debauchery.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>Benjamin Constant is only thirty-seven, yet he
already feels himself an old man, whose powers are
failing, who is no longer capable of strong emotion,
or even of taking an intelligent interest in life.
He writes, in fact, as if he were very tired. When
something happens to remind him of his old attachment
to Madame de Charrière, he writes thus:</p>

<p>'It is seven years since I saw her&mdash;ten since our
intimacy ended. How easily I then used to break
every tie that bored me! How confident I was
that I could always form others when I pleased!
How clearly I felt that my life was mine to do
what I liked with, and what a difference ten years
have made! Now everything seems precarious,
and ready to fly away from me. Even the privileges
that I have do not make me happy. But I
have passed the age of giving up anything, because
I feel that I am powerless to replace anything.'</p>

<p>He describes&mdash;sometimes with a languid resignation,
and sometimes with a peevish resentment&mdash;Madame
de Staël's repeated endeavours to drag
him, a more or less reluctant victim, at her chariot
wheels. This is a very typical entry:</p>

<p>'A lively supper with the Prince de Belmonte.
Left alone with Madame de Staël. The storm
gradually rises. A fearful scene, lasting till three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
o'clock in the morning&mdash;on my lack of sensibility,
my untrustworthiness, the failure of my actions to
correspond with my sentiments. Alas! I would
be glad to escape from monotonous lamentations,
not over real calamities, but upon the universal
laws of nature, and upon the advent of old age. I
should be glad if she would not ask me for love
after a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaison</i> of ten years' standing, at a time when
we are both nearly forty years old, and after I have
declared, times out of number, that I have no
longer any love to give her. It is a declaration
which I have never withdrawn, except for the purpose
of calming storms of passion which frightened
me.'</p>

<p>So is this:</p>

<p>'A letter from Madame de Staël, who finds my
letters melancholy, and asks what it is that I require
to make me happy. Alas! what I require is
my liberty, and that is precisely what I am not
allowed to have. I am reminded of the story of
the hussar who took an interest in the prisoner
whom he had to put to death, and said to him:
"Ask me any favour you like, except to spare
your life."'</p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p>'A fearful scene this evening with Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Staël. I announce my intention of leaving her
definitely. A second scene follows. Frenzy:
reconciliation impossible; departure difficult. I
must go away and get married.'</p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p>'Madame de Staël has won me back to her
again.'</p>

<p>Until, finally, their relations gradually going
from bad to worse, we reach this striking piece of
eloquence:</p>

<p>'Yes, certainly I am more anxious than ever to
break it off. She is the most egoistical, the most
excitable, the most ungrateful, the most vain, and
the most vindictive of women. Why didn't I
break it off long ago? She is odious and intolerable
to me. I must have done with her or die.
She is more volcanic than all the volcanoes in the
world put together. She is like an old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur</i>,
with serpents in her hair, demanding the fulfilment
of a contract in Alexandrine verse.'</p>

<p>It was in marriage that Benjamin Constant
gradually decided to seek a haven of refuge from
these tempestuous passions. But, though he is
continually touching on the subject in his diary, he
generally refers to it without enthusiasm. Marriage
is 'necessary' for him, but there are objections to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
every particular marriage that suggests itself.
Sometimes the objections are expressed in general
terms:</p>

<p>'Went to a party, where I met several agreeable
women. But I am very unfortunate. In the
women whom I might be able and willing to marry
there is always a something that does not suit me.
Meanwhile my life advances.'</p>

<p>Sometimes the objections are particularized:</p>

<p>'Trip to Geneva; called on the Mesdemoiselles de
Sellon; saw Amélie Fabry again. She is as dark
as ever, as lively as ever, as wide awake as ever.
How I should have hated her, if they had succeeded
in making me marry her! Yet she is really a very
amiable girl. But I am always unfortunate in
finding some insuperable objection in every woman
whom I think of marrying. Madame de Hardenberg
was tiresome and romantic; Mrs. Lindsay
was forty, and had two illegitimate children.
Madame de Staël, who understands me better than
anyone else does, will not be satisfied with my
friendship when I can no longer give her my love.
This poor Amélie, who would like me to marry
her, is thirty-two, and portionless, and has ridiculous
mannerisms, which become more accentuated
as she grows older. Antoinette, who is twenty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
well off, and not particularly ridiculous, is such a
common little thing to look at.'</p>

<p>But Benjamin Constant finally decided to marry
Madame Dutertre.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He bought her from her
husband, who, for a sum of money, was willing to
divorce her; but it was not without a violent
struggle that he tore himself away from Madame
de Staël. Let us trace the story of the struggle
in his diary. Madame Dutertre was an old
friend:</p>

<p>'Called on Madame Dutertre, who has improved
wonderfully in appearance. I made advances
which she did not repel. The citadel is to fall
to-night. Two years' resistance is quite long
enough.</p>

<p>'Off to the country with Charlotte. She is an
angel. I love her better every day. She is so
sweet, so amiable. What a fool I was to refuse to
have anything to do with her twelve years ago!
What mad passion for independence drove me to
put my neck under the foot of the most imperious
woman in the world!</p>

<p>'We are back in Paris. Joyous days; delights
of love. What the devil is the meaning of it? It
is twelve years since I last felt a similar emotion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>This woman, whom I have refused a hundred
times, who has always loved me, whom I have sent
away, whom I left eighteen months ago&mdash;this
woman now turns my head. Evidently the contrast
with Madame de Staël is the cause of it all. The
contrast of her impetuosity, her egoism, and her
continual preoccupation with herself, with the
gentleness, the calm, the humble and modest
bearing of Charlotte, makes the latter a thousand
times more dear to me. I am tired of the <i>man-woman</i>
whose iron hand has for ten years held me
fast, when I have a really womanly woman to
intoxicate and enchant me. If I can marry her, I
shall not hesitate. Everything depends on the line
M. Dutertre takes.'</p>

<p>M. Dutertre, as has been stated, took the line of
offering to consent to a divorce provided it were
made worth his while to do so. Madame de Staël
was more difficult to deal with. The first entry
which gives us a glimpse of her feelings is as
follows:</p>

<p>'Madame de Staël is back; she will not hear of
our relations being broken off. The best way will
be not to see her again, but to wait at Lausanne
for orders from Charlotte&mdash;my good angel whom
I bless for saving me. Schlegel writes that Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
de Staël declares that, if I leave her, she will kill
herself. I don't believe a word of it.'</p>

<p>Followed by:</p>

<p>'Unhappy fool that I am; weakness overcomes
me; I start for Coppet. Tenderness, despair, and
then the trump card, "I shall kill myself."'</p>

<p>He fled to Lausanne, but&mdash;</p>

<p>'What was the good of coming here? Madame
de Staël has come after me, and all my plans are
upset. In the evening there was a fearful scene,
lasting till five o'clock in the morning. I am
violent, and put myself in the wrong. But, my
poor Charlotte, I will not forsake you.'</p>

<p>Yet he had hardly written these lines when he
was false to them. Madame de Staël came a second
time to Lausanne to fetch him, and we read:</p>

<p>'She came; she threw herself at my feet; she
raised frightful cries of pain and desolation. A
heart of iron would not have resisted. I am back
at Coppet with her. I have promised to stay six
weeks, and Charlotte is expecting me at the end
of the month. My God! what am I to do? I
am trampling my future happiness under my
feet....</p>

<p>'I receive a letter from Charlotte, who is more
loving and more sure of me than ever. Would she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
forgive me if she knew where I am and what I am
doing? How slowly the time passes! Into what
an abysm have I not hurled myself! Last night
we had a dreadful scene. Shall I ever get out of
it all alive? I have to pass my time in falsehood
and deceptions in order to avoid the furious outbreaks
which so terrify me. If it were not for the
hopes which I build upon Madame de Staël's
approaching departure to Vienna, this life would be
unbearable. To console myself I spend my time
in picturing how things will go if they go well.
This is my Castle in Spain. Charlotte finishes her
arrangements, and makes her preparations secretly.
Madame de Staël, suspecting nothing, sets out for
Vienna. I marry Charlotte, and we pass the
winter pleasantly at Lausanne.'</p>

</div>

<p>Though this was not exactly how things happened,
the marriage was nevertheless speedily and
safely celebrated. But alas! poor Benjamin! It
was now his turn, in the midst of his domestic bliss,
to feel the pangs of unrequited love. Having fled
from Madame de Staël, he sighed for her. His
diary is full of his regrets. It is:</p>

<p>'Charlotte is good and sweet. I build myself
foolish ideals, and throw the blame of my own folly
upon others. At bottom Charlotte is what women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
always are. I have blamed individuals where I
ought to have blamed the species. But for my
work, and for the good advice that I need, I regret
Madame de Staël more than ever.'</p>

<p>Or it is:</p>

<p>'A letter from Madame de Staël, from which I
gather that, this time, all is really over between us.
So be it. It is my own doing. I must steer my
course alone, but I must take care not to fetter
myself with other ties which would be infinitely
less agreeable.'</p>

<p>Or again:</p>

<p>'I have lost Madame de Staël, and I shall never
recover from the blow.'</p>

<p>And the truth was, indeed, that Madame de
Staël had ceased to care, and that another had
succeeded to Benjamin Constant's place in her
heart.</p>

<p>His name was Albert de Rocca, and he was a
young French officer who had been wounded in the
Spanish wars. His personal beauty was such that
a Spanish woman, finding him left for dead upon a
battle-field, had taken him home with her, and
nursed him back to health, saying that it was a
pity that such a beautiful young man should die.
His age was twenty-three, and Madame de Staël's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was forty-five. But the affection that sprang up
between them was deep and genuine. 'I will love
her,' he said, 'so dearly that she will end by marrying
me.' And when she protested that she was
old enough to be his mother, he answered that the
mention of that word only gave him a further
reason for loving her. 'He is fascinated,' Baron de
Voght wrote, 'by his relations with Madame de
Staël, and the tears of his father cannot induce him
to abandon it.'</p>

<p>So she married him, though, for reasons of her
own, she insisted that the marriage should be kept
a secret. It seemed to her that a young husband
would make her ridiculous, but that a young lover
would not; very possibly she was right according to
the moral standard of the age. At any rate her
husband posed as her lover, and in that capacity
quarrelled with Constant, with whom he nearly
fought a duel, and travelled with her to Russia, to
Sweden, and to England, and lived with her in
Paris and at Coppet. But it was at this period,
when her fame was at its zenith, that Madame de
Staël wrote: 'Fame is for women only a splendid
mourning for happiness.'</p>

<p>But the end was drawing near. Madame de Staël
had lived all her life at high pressure, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
health was undermined. A lingering illness, of
which the fatal issue was foreseen, overtook her.
She struggled against it, declaring that she would
live for Rocca's sake. But all in vain. She died
in Paris in 1817. Rocca himself, who only survived
her a few months, was too ill to be with her.
Benjamin Constant spent a night of mourning in
her death-chamber. They buried her at Coppet
amid general lamentations.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<small>THE REVOLUTION</small></h2>


<p>At Lausanne, as at Geneva, the thunders of the
French Revolution echoed. Gibbon heard them,
and was alarmed, as if at the approach of the end of
the world. The patriots of Vaud heard them, and
rejoiced at the hope of a new era about to be begun.
Their Excellencies of Berne felt the edifice of their
dominion crumbling about their ears. The burghers
of Morges began the trouble by disinterring from
their archives an old charter, on the strength of
which they refused to pay for the mending of
the roads, while a pastor named Martin exhorted
his congregation to withhold the tithe that was
levied on potatoes. Then a fête was held at Rolle
to celebrate the anniversary of the fall of the
Bastille, and 6,000 Bernese invaded the country,
arrested the ringleaders, and compelled the magistrates
to swear allegiance at the point of the
bayonet. César Laharpe and J. J. Cart appealed
to the French to intervene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the French hesitated. Robespierre was
not ambitious of foreign conquests, having his
hands full enough at home, but the Directorate
took larger views. Switzerland was reputed to be
rich&mdash;and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">was für plunder</i>! A division of the
army of Italy crossed the lake on January 28, 1798,
and took possession of Lausanne. For a space
there was civil war. Vaudois volunteers fought
under their green flag, while a certain Loyal Legion,
under Colonel de Rovéreaz, distinguished itself at
Fraubrunnen, in defence of Berne. The French,
however, were so much stronger than the Bernese
that the issue could not long remain in doubt. It
was the Swiss money that the French wanted, and
the gold found in the vaults of the Treasury of
Berne was carried off to Paris, while the Canton of
Vaud was accorded a new and independent constitution.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE RHONE VALLEY FROM
MONT PELERIN</p></div>
</div>

<p>There were other revolutions, and revisions,
and reconstructions to follow. When the Holy
Alliance remodelled the map of Europe in 1815,
the fate of Vaud, like that of so many other minor
nationalities, hung in the balance. The Bernese
fully expected to be allowed to re-establish their
dominion; but Alexander I., prompted by Laharpe,
prevented them. 'You have done a great deal for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
me,' the Emperor is reported to have said to the
Liberator. 'What can I do for you?' And the
Liberator's answer was: 'Sire, all that I ask is
permission to speak to your Majesty of my country
whenever I wish.' He spoke in 1815, and the
Emperor listened; and the claims of Berne were
rejected; and Laharpe took a house at Lausanne,
and looked down on the scene of his triumphs, and
fought his battles over again, and frequented
Madame de Staël, whom in more stormy days he
had written of as '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une infernale gueuse</span>,' and was
reverenced by all as the 'Grand Old Man' of the
Canton.</p>

<p>There were further political changes in 1830, in
1845, and in 1861; but of these we need not speak.
Their interest is no more than local. What the
English traveller chiefly sees in the Lausanne of
the nineteenth century is an increasing English
colony, and the loudly vaunted educational facilities.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<small>THE ENGLISH COLONY&mdash;THE EDUCATIONAL
ADVANTAGES</small></h2>


<p>Of the English colony there is not perhaps a
great deal to be said, except that it fills two
churches on Sundays, and at all times monopolizes
the Ouchy road. It has never consisted of distinguished
persons like the English colony at
Florence; on the other hand, it has never included
so large a proportion of disreputable persons as the
English colonies at Brussels and Boulogne. Gibbon
cannot be said to have belonged to it, since, in his
day, it did not yet exist; and it can hardly claim
Dickens, since his sojourn there was of comparatively
brief duration. In the main it is composed of very
young and rather elderly members of the respectable
middle classes. There is an English club, and
there are opportunities of playing bridge. The
life is inexpensive, not because commodities are
specially cheap, but because there are no wealthy
residents to set extravagant standards. A small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
income goes a long way there; and the climate is
salubrious for all those whose bronchial tubes are in
a condition to resist the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bise</i>.</p>

<p>These are conditions which please a great many
people&mdash;notably the wandering spinsters who 'live
in their boxes,' and the retired officers and civil servants
who have to subsist upon their pensions. At
Lausanne they can economize without feeling the
pinch of poverty, and without feeling envious&mdash;or
perceiving that their wives feel envious&mdash;of more
prosperous neighbours. The sunshine costs nothing,
and the amusements cost very little; they can go
about in knickerbockers and wear out their old
clothes without fearing that their solvency will be
suspected. There is no need for them to learn a
foreign tongue, since they form their own society,
and mix very little with the Swiss who accept
them, but do not pretend to like them. They live
lazily, but healthily, and, on the whole, contentedly.</p>

<p>Of course, there is another side to the medal,
and a price to be paid for the advantages. The
colonists are exiles who have severed old ties, and
have a difficulty in forming new ones. Their existence
is rather animal than human, and rather vegetable
than animal. They lose their energy and
their intelligence; they are like plants no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
growing in a garden, but uprooted and flung upon
the grass. A stranger finds it difficult to converse
with them, and fancies that they must be terribly
bored. Perhaps they are; but perhaps, too, it is
better to be bored in the sunshine than busy in a
London fog. So they linger on, persuading themselves
that they do so for their children's sake
rather than their own, and referring the stranger,
if he happens to question them, to the wonderful
educational advantages of the town.</p>

<p>But what is the sober truth about those educational
advantages? That is another branch of the
subject which seems to be worth a passing word.</p>

<p>Assuredly the Swiss have a great reputation as
educators, and that reputation stands nowhere
higher than in the Canton of Vaud. Yverdon is
in the Canton of Vaud, and it was there that Pestalozzi
kept his school. Moreover, just as it has
been said that every citizen of Ticino is by nature
a hotel-keeper, so it has been said that every citizen
of Vaud is by nature a professor. Professors, as
we have already seen, were among the Canton's
chief 'articles of export' during the Bernese
domination, and kings preferred the Vaudois professors
to any others. Yet a sufficient number of
professors&mdash;and perhaps the best of them&mdash;have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
always remained behind, so that teaching and learning
have continued to be great native industries.
The question which is left is, How do the Swiss
systems of education compare with ours?</p>

<p>The answer is commonplace, and sounds platitudinous:
they are better than ours in some respects,
and inferior in others. Let us elaborate
and particularize.</p>

<p>Scholarship, in the accepted English sense of the
word, hardly exists in Switzerland. A Swiss Jebb
is almost unthinkable, and if anyone proposes to
find a Swiss Bentley in Casaubon, the answer must
be that Casaubon was not really Swiss, though he
was, for a time, a professor at Geneva. In the
matter of the classics the German scholars have
always been more learned than the Swiss, and the
English scholars have always been both more
learned and more graceful; indeed, in the sort of
scholarship which enables a man to speak and write
his own language properly the Swiss have always
been sadly to seek. Swiss French is atrocious, and
the French of Lausanne, though a shade better than
that of Fribourg, is worse than that of Geneva or
Neuchâtel. When the French themselves wish to
say that a man's style is clumsy, they liken it to 'a
Swiss translation from the Belgian.'</p>

<p><a name="i_131" id="i_131">&nbsp;</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="329" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A STREET IN ST. SAPHORIN</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor have the Swiss ever made any notable contribution
to original philosophic thought. Their
principal metaphysicians, like Charles Bonnet, have
been merely theologians in disguise, who have
started by assuming the points which they undertook
to prove, and have been unable to keep their
metaphysics and their theology apart, as did, for
example, Bishop Berkeley and Dean Mansell. The
great names in the history of speculative thought&mdash;such
names as those of Spinoza, Locke, Hume,
Kant, Hegel, Comte, Herbert Spencer, and T. H.
Green&mdash;have been English, or German, or French,
or Dutch. One does not find a single Swiss name
among them. The great Swiss names, when we
get away from theology, all stand for something
scientific, practical, concrete. Lavater, Gesner,
Saussure, Jomini&mdash;such are a few of the instances
that may be cited to point our moral and lead us
up to our generalization, which is as follows:</p>

<p>Elementary education is excellent in Switzerland;
but the higher education is too technical and
utilitarian to satisfy those who consider that the
function of education is to cultivate the mind.
The elementary schools of the Canton of Vaud are
probably better than those of the County of London;
but the Universities of Geneva and Lausanne are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a poor substitute for those of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p>Let us by all means give praise where praise is
due. The Medical Faculties of Berne and Lausanne
have a European reputation; and it is said that
engineering is nowhere taught better than at the
Zurich Polytechnic. The practical side of the Swiss
character is also well exemplified in the various
schools for waiters, for watch-makers, and for bee-keepers.
But it is possible&mdash;or it seems so to an
English University man&mdash;for education to be too
practical; and the Swiss have surely committed
that excess in devising that educational abomination,
the School of Commerce. Nothing is ever
taught in a School of Commerce that a man who
has been properly educated elsewhere cannot pick
up in six weeks; and the curriculum, though it
may sharpen the wits, can only, at the best, produce
a superior kind of bagman.</p>

<p>Swiss education, therefore, has its drawbacks
even for a Switzer; and, for a young Englishman
of the better class, it has other drawbacks in addition.
It is not merely that he learns less than he would
in England because an unfamiliar language is the
medium of instruction. He also acquires the wrong
tone and the wrong manner, misses opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of making useful friends, and finds himself, when
he grows up, a stranger in his own country&mdash;a
stranger not only to the people, but to the ways
and modes of thought. That is a disadvantage
which was pointed out as long ago as the eighteenth
century, by Dr. John Moore, when a nobleman
who had thought of sending his son to the
University of Geneva asked his advice on the
subject. 'The boy would return,' said the doctor,
'a kind of a Frenchman, and would so be disqualified
for success in English life.'</p>

<p>The same criticism still applies. We are better
cosmopolitans nowadays than were Dr. Moore's
contemporaries, but the differences between the
nations still subsist; and, just as each nation has
the system of education which it deserves, so it has
the system of education which best prepares a man
to fight the battle of life in his own country. In
England, more than in any other country, success
depends comparatively little upon book-learning,
and very much upon character and the possession
of certain qualities which, in our insular pride, we
vaunt as specially 'British.' These qualities are
not to be acquired in the Swiss schools. The
qualities that are to be acquired there may, in
some respects, be better and more solid; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
are not so useful in Great Britain. An English boy
educated in a Swiss school is, as a rule, when he
leaves, rather a clumsy lout, with a smattering of
bad French, emancipated from certain prejudices
which might be useful to him, but steeped in other
prejudices which are likely to stand in his way.
One always has the feeling that more might have
been made of him at home: not merely at Eton
or Harrow, but at Clifton or Marlborough, or even
at St. Paul's or the Bedford Grammar School.</p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, the educational <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison
d'être</i> of the English colony at Lausanne disappears
under investigation&mdash;at any rate, so far as the boys
are concerned. The girls, from a certain point of
view, may be better off there; for the Swiss girls'
schools are good, and the snobbishness which is the
vice of English girls' schools is discouraged in them.
For the girls, difficulties only arise when they
reach a marriageable age. There are no husbands
for them at Lausanne, or anywhere in Switzerland,
unless it be at Montreux, where Anglo-Indians
sometimes come on leave, since all the men whom
they meet&mdash;one is speaking only of their own
countrymen&mdash;are either too young or too old&mdash;mere
students, or else superannuated veterans.
They know it, and lament their lot aloud; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the Swiss know it, too, and make remarks. The
English colony at Lausanne, they say, is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une vraie
pépinière de vieilles filles</i>.</p>

<p>But this is an excursus. We must return to
Lausanne, and take another look at its social and
intellectual life.</p>

<small>VINET AND SAINTE-BEUVE&mdash;JUSTE OLIVIER</small></h2>


<p>The centre of the intellectual life was always the
University. It could not be otherwise in a country in
which every man is born a pedagogue. In England
the view has come to prevail that literature only
begins to be vital when it ceases to be academic.
In the Canton of Vaud the literature is academic
or nothing, and even the poets are professors,
unbending in their hours of sentimental ease; while
the literature of revolt is the bitter cry of professors
who have forfeited their chairs on account of their
religious or political opinions. As the result of
each revolution in turn we see a company of
professors put to flight. The casualties of that sort
are at least as numerous as the broken heads.</p>

<p>The detailed relation of such professorial vicissitudes
belongs, however, to the native antiquary.
Here it will suffice to recall a few more notable
names.</p>

<p>A Swiss historian would doubtless say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
greatest of the names is that of Alexandre Vinet.
In his hot youth he wrote riotous poetry:</p>

<div class="cpoem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O mes amis, vidons bouteille<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et laissons faire le destin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le Dieu qui préside à la treille<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Est notre unique souverain.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Afterwards he became austere, and played a
great part in theological controversy. He hated
the Revivalists, whom he described as 'lunatics at
large'; but he insisted that religious liberty should
be the heritage of all, and, while opposing established
churches, exercised a profound spiritual
influence. He was a great Broad Churchman, and
we may class him as the F. W. Robertson or
F. D. Maurice of the Canton of Vaud. Sainte-Beuve
blew his trumpet, and he, on his part,
almost persuaded Sainte-Beuve to become a Protestant.</p>

<p>Sainte-Beuve, it is hardly too much to say,
came to Lausanne in search of a religion. St.
Simonism had disappointed him, and so had the
Liberal Catholicism of Lamennais. Lamennais,
in fact, had gone too fast and too far for him&mdash;had,
as it were, he said, taken him for a drive, and spilt
him in a ditch, and left him there and driven on.
None the less, he earnestly desired to be spiritually-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and a devout believer, feeling, in particular,
an inclination towards mysticism, though unable
to profess himself a mystic. 'I have,' he wrote to
a friend, 'the sense of these things, but not the
things themselves.' It seemed to him that he
might find 'the things themselves' at Lausanne,
if he went there in the proper spirit and sat at
Vinet's feet.</p>

<p>His Swiss friend, Juste Olivier, a professor who
was also a poet, procured him an engagement to
deliver a course of lectures at the Lausanne
Academy,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and he embarked upon his errand with
as much humility as was compatible with professorship.
Left free to choose his own subject, he
decided to treat of Port Royal and the Jansenists&mdash;the
most spiritually-minded of the Catholics, and
those who had the closest affinity with the Protestants.
By means of his lectures he thought to
build himself a bridge by which to pass from the
one camp to the other.</p>

<p>His elocution was defective, and his lectures
were not quite such a success as he could have
wished. The students used to meet in the cafés
to parody them in the evenings. On the other
hand, however, serious people eagerly watched the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>developments of the spiritual drama. Not only
did it seem to them that the fate of a soul was in
the balance&mdash;they were also hoping to see Protestantism
score the sort of triumph that would
make a noise in Paris. So they asked daily for
news of Sainte-Beuve, as of a sick man lying at
death's door, and asked Vinet, whom they regarded
as his spiritual physician, to issue a bulletin. And
Vinet's bulletin was to this effect: 'I think he is
convinced, but not yet converted.' But Vinet, as
he was soon to discover, was only partly right.</p>

<p>That Sainte-Beuve was not converted was, indeed,
obvious enough, seeing that he was making
violent love to his neighbour's wife at the time&mdash;between
him and 'conversion' stood the obstructive
charms of Madame Olivier. But it is equally
true that he was not convinced; and, by a crowning
irony, he found his faith evaporating as he got
to close quarters with the subject, through the
study of which he had expected to achieve conviction.
The great history of Port Royal, begun by
a believer, was finished by a sceptic. 'Moral bankruptcy,'
is M. Michaut's description of his condition,
and there is a sense in which it might be applied
even by those who desire to dissociate morality
from creeds. It was the end&mdash;at any rate, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Sainte-Beuve&mdash;of all emotion which was not either
purely sensual or purely intellectual. He could
not be a mystic, as he could not be a poet, because
he lacked the necessary genius; and forms of
religion which depended, not on intuition, but on
authority, were repugnant to his sane intelligence.
So he said a sad farewell to Christianity, and sought
no substitute. 'I am mournfully looking on at
the death of my heart,' he wrote to Vinet; and he
went away and resigned himself to become a
materialist, a voluptuary, and a critic.</p>

<p>And now a word about that Juste Olivier to
whom Sainte-Beuve owed his appointment, and to
whose wife Sainte-Beuve made love. The poet
and the critic had met at Paris, where Olivier had
gone to prepare himself for the Chair of Literature
at Neuchâtel. He was promoted, three years later,
to the Chair of History at Lausanne, which he
occupied for twelve years, acting also, during part
of the time, as editor of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue Suisse</i>, to which
Sainte-Beuve contributed. The Revolution of
1845 unseated him. He went to Paris, where he
achieved no great success, and was homesick there
for five-and-twenty years. The Swiss forgot him,
and the Parisians did not understand him. But,
in 1870, when there was no longer a living to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
made in Paris, he came home again. One may
quote the pathetic picture of his home-coming,
drawn by M. Philippe Godet:</p>

<p>'He had to live. For three winters the poet
travelled through French Switzerland, lecturing,
reading his verses, relating his reminiscences, with
that melancholy humour which gave his speech its
charm. The public&mdash;I speak of what I saw&mdash;was
polite, respectful, and nothing more. Olivier felt
almost a stranger in his own country. But he
consoled himself, in the summer, at Gryon, "the
high village facing the Alps of Vaud," which he
has so often celebrated. He was to sing, at the
mid-August fête, his song to the Shepherds of
Anzeindaz. And there they understood him and
applauded. He had his day of happiness and
glory among these simple mountaineers. He was,
for an hour, what it had been the dream of his life
to be, the national singer of the Vaudois country.'</p>

<p>But the end is melancholy. He died in a chalet
at Gryon in January, 1876, a broken and disappointed
man, reluctant even to speak of his work
or hear it spoken of. There is a deep pathos in
one of his last letters which M. Godet quotes:</p>

<p>'It is a melancholy history&mdash;that of our country.
It did nothing for Viret or Vinet; and, though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
do not rank myself with them, I too know what
neglect means. "Come and have a drink"&mdash;that
is their last word here. I had hoped for better
things. What a beautiful dream it was! At least
I have been loyal to it, even if I have not, as
I fancy, done all that it was in me to do. Since
the day when, in one of my first printed poems,
I wrote, "Un génie est caché dans tous les lieux
que j'aime," I have obstinately sought out that
genius, and tried to make it speak. It has answered
me, I think more often than its voice has been
heard.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />

<small>NYON</small></h2>


<p>Lausanne, for the purposes of this volume, must be
taken to include such neighbouring lake-side towns
as Morges, and Rolle, and Nyon. Morges we have
already seen distinguishing itself by refusing, on
principle, to pay for the mending of the roads, and
so paving the way for the subsequent insurrection.
Nowadays it is the seat of an arsenal, and is said to
have an aristocratic population, interested in literature.
Rolle was the home of the Laharpes, and
boasts a statue of César de Laharpe by Pradier. A
colony of French and Genevan political exiles
once flourished there, and Madame de Staël was a
frequent visitor. Voltaire once proposed to buy an
estate in the neighbourhood&mdash;the Château des
Menthon&mdash;but the Bernese would not let him do
so, alleging the curious reason that the philosopher
was a Roman Catholic. Nyon is the dirtiest town
on the Lake&mdash;or would be if Villeneuve were not
dirtier. But it is also one of the most picturesque&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
castle being nobly situated and in a fine state
of preservation&mdash;and it has its interesting memories.</p>

<p>One of its interesting associations is with the
Waldenses. These persecuted Protestants had
fled, or been driven out, from their mountain home
above Turin. Switzerland received them hospitably,
but they were homesick. They resolved to go
back; not to slink back in twos and threes, but to
march back, with their flags flying, like courageous
Christian soldiers. They mustered at Nyon, and
thence crossed the lake under the leadership of
the fighting pastor, Henri Arnaud, and marched
across the mountains to effect their 'glorious re-entry.'
It was a great military feat, and no less
a judge than Napoleon has paid his tribute to
the military genius of the commander. The returning
exiles defeated the soldiers of Savoy in
more than one pitched battle. One thinks of them
generally as the 'slaughtered saints, whose bones'
inspired one of the finest of Milton's sonnets, but
theirs were not the only bones that whitened the
valleys during that notable expedition.</p>

<p>Nyon again recalls the memory of Bonstetten,
who governed it for a season on behalf of Berne.
If all the Bernese Governors had been like him,
Vaud would have been a contented country, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
he is chiefly remembered as a wit and a man of
culture, who lived to be eighty-seven without ever
seeming to grow old. In his youth he travelled in
England, and was the friend of Gray; in his old age
he lived at Geneva, and was the friend of Byron.
In the meantime he had been the friend of
Madame de Staël, and a pillar of the cosmopolitan
society at Coppet. He wrote some books, but they
are dead and buried. What lives is the recollection
of the genial old gentleman whom everybody liked,
and who proved&mdash;what needed a great deal of
proving&mdash;that it was possible for a Bernese to be
gracious and frivolous, and to have a sense of
humour. He detested the society of his native
city, and wrote a delightfully sarcastic description
of its daily life in a letter to one of the Hallers:</p>

<p>'We are living here, as we always do. We sleep,
we breakfast, we yawn, we drag through the morning,
and we digest our food. And then we dine,
and then we dress, and then we swagger in the
Arcades, and say to ourselves: "I am charming and
clever, for the spelling of my name makes me
capable of governing and illuminating two hundred
thousand souls." And then we accost a lady with a
pretty figure decently enveloped in a mantle, and
then we go to a party and circle round a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
turtle-doves, and deliver ourselves of platitudes
with the air of saying something clever. Then we
have something to eat, and, finding our intellectual
resources exhausted, amuse ourselves with paper
games; and then we go to bed, feeling satisfied with
ourselves&mdash;for we have been delightful.'</p>

<p>Out of sympathy with Berne, Bonstetten had a
good deal more sympathy than Berne liked with
the revolutionary party. It is said that his sympathies
lost him his post; but before that happened
he had time to render a useful service to one of the
most eminent of the revolutionists. He was at
supper one day with a considerable number of
guests when his servant whispered in his ear that a
mysterious stranger was without, asking to speak
with him. He stepped into the garden, where a
man, miserably dressed, was waiting for him in the
summer-house. He inquired his errand, and the
answer was: 'I am Carnot, and I am perishing
from hunger. I implore you to give me shelter for
the night.' Bonstetten not only gave him shelter
for the night, but, on the following morning, gave
him a passport under an assumed name. One can
understand that his superiors at Berne did not
regard him as a model functionary, but Carnot
never forgot his kindness. When he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Napoleon's War Minister, he invited him to Paris,
introduced him to the Emperor, and heaped proofs
of his gratitude upon him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>CULLY FROM EPESSE: AUTUMN</p></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it is also worth noting that, in the days
before the railways, Nyon was on the highroad
from France to Switzerland. The track descended
there from Saint-Cergues, where it crossed the
Jura; and by it travelled Madame de Staël, and
Benjamin Constant, and Voltaire, and many another
whom we have met in the course of this rambling
narrative. There is a new road now, with wide,
sweeping curves, and a gentle gradient; but enough
of the old road remains to show us how shamefully
bad it was&mdash;a narrow road, of uneven surface, plunging
headlong through the pine-forest. The lumbering
old coaches, with their six horses, must have
had a very bad time there, and it is no wonder
that Napoleon ordered a road to be made over the
Col de la Faucille to supersede it.</p>

<p>But enough of Nyon and the Canton de Vaud!
We must cross the lake to the French shore; and,
as first impressions are always the most graphic,
permission has been obtained to print here the
writer's own first impressions, contributed a few
years since, to the columns of the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />

<small>THE FRENCH SHORE</small></h2>


<p>What strikes the holiday traveller about the
French shore is that it is so much better managed
than the Swiss shore. Its natural advantages are
fewer&mdash;they are, in fact, very few indeed. Evian&mdash;and
when one speaks of the French shore one is
principally thinking of Evian&mdash;stands with its back
to the high mountains instead of facing them.
Consequently it has no views to compare with the
views from Lausanne, Geneva, and Vevey. Its
hinterland is commonplace, except for those
who make a great effort and go up the Dent
d'Oche. The mouth of the Dranse, hard by, is a
dreary collection of detritus. There are hardly any
literary landmarks, except the few that recall the
memory of St. Francis de Sales. Whence English
travellers have, almost with one accord, drawn the
inference that it is not worth while to go to Evian.
But they are wrong. The French think otherwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and the French are right. They do not go there,
as some suppose, because they are crippled with
diseases and need the waters to wash poisons out
of their blood and their organs: the Evian water is
the sort of water that the whole, as well as the sick,
can drink by the bucketful without feeling a penny
the worse for it. Their purpose in going to Evian
is to live a life of luxury and leisure. No doubt
they pay through the nose for the privilege. Inquiry
at one hotel elicited the statement that the worst
rooms were let at eight and the best at eighty francs
a day&mdash;with service <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la carte</i> on the same scale.
But other hotels are cheaper, and it is also possible
to hire a villa, a flat, a lodging; and, in any case,
it is right that Evian should be introduced to the
English tourist as the one place on the Lake of
Geneva in which the life of leisure and luxury is
possible.</p>

<p>There is no real luxury at Geneva itself, though
there are high prices and immense hotels. Instead
of having good music at fixed hours, they
have indifferent music all day long. The whole
air is full of a continual tinkle-tinkle; louder than
the tinkle-tinkle rises the hooting of the steamers
and the trams; louder still are the voices of the
trippers, mostly Americans, inquiring the prices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
things, or complaining that they have lost their
luggage. The society at the boasted Kursaal is an
unpolished horde, mainly composed of the Geneva
clerks and shop-assistants losing their salaries at
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits chevaux</i>. Nor are things much better elsewhere
on the Swiss shore. Nyon, for instance, is
by nature an earthly paradise, and they have formed
a society for developing it. What they really want
is a society for cleaning it, since it is the present
practice of the inhabitants to empty their dustbins
over their garden walls into the lake, with
results appalling to the nostrils of the stranger.
At Lausanne, or Vevey, or Montreux&mdash;other
earthly paradises&mdash;you escape this nuisance; but
even there, in the season, you have the feeling that
the place is one vast hotel, and that everybody is
waiting with packed boxes for the omnibus. But
cross to Evian. The town is a little smaller than
Montreux, but just as full. Yet it never seems to
be crowded. There is no hurrying or bustling.
You are in nobody's way, and nobody is in your
way; which means that Evian is properly
managed.</p>

<p>They do not encourage you to come to Evian in
the capacity of tripper. On the contrary, they try
to arrange things so that you must sacrifice your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
lunch in order to get there, and your dinner in
order to get home. But this is a part of the secret
of good management, as you will appreciate if you
stay there. No knickerbockered army, headed by
a polyglot guide in a straw hat with a label on it,
will invade your peace, but you will be free to live
your lotus-eating life in your own way. You will
probably live most of it in the casino, which is a
proper casino, differing from the Geneva Kursaal
as cheese from chalk. There is so much shade that
it is always cool there, even on the hottest day.
You will lunch there on a shaded terrace, assisted
by a sympathetic waiter, who understands that a
good lunch is an end in itself, and not merely a
device for keeping body and soul together until the
evening. You will linger long and agreeably over
the coffee and liqueurs, without feeling that someone
else wants your seat. Nor will you be bothered,
as in Geneva, by the squeaking of a futile fiddle, or
by hawkers offering picture postcards. But, at the
appointed hour, there will be a proper concert with
a programme, and a well-behaved and well-dressed
audience: beautiful French ladies looking as if they
had stepped out of fashion plates; beautiful French
children looking as if they had been cut out of
Aunt Louisa's picture-book; fantastic Frenchmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
looking as if they were dressed for amateur
theatricals. Then, when the evening comes, and
you have dined as well as you have lunched, there
will be a performance in the little theatre, given by
artistes from Paris, who come on to Evian from
Aix-les-Bains: Réjane, Jeanne Granier, Charlotte
Wiehe, or others. Or there will be a ball in
the grand style&mdash;not in the least like the balls in
the Hall-by-the-Sea at Margate&mdash;given in as good
a ballroom as the heart of a dancer could wish for.
But no hurrying, or hustling, or excitement. At
Evian, if nowhere else on Lake Leman, life is a
leisurely pageant.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GRANDVAUX FROM CULLY</p></div>
</div>

<p>For the rest, there is little enough for you to do&mdash;nothing,
in fact, except to stroll up and down the
long avenue of linked plane-trees by the lake-side,
observe how clean they keep the water, and gaze
across its calm surface to the Swiss shore where the
trippers make a noise. But this has always been a
favourite occupation of the dwellers on the French
shore, whether in fact or works of fiction. From
Meillerie St. Preux gazed across at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bosquet</i>
of Clarens. From Thonon St. Francis de Sales
gazed across, pondering plans for working the
Counter-Reformation in the Canton de Vaud.
From Evian itself, Madame de Warens gazed across,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
regretting the home of her youth to which she
could never return, because, when she left it, she
had abandoned her religion, and taken with her
certain goods and chattels which her creditors were
about to seize.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<small>HISTORY OF THE FRENCH SHORE&mdash;FELIX V</small></h2>


<p>The history of the French shore, which has only
recently belonged to France, may be told in briefest
outline. In the earliest times of which we need
take cognizance it belonged to the Dukes of Savoy,
whose domains continued for a considerable distance
up the valley of the Rhone. Then came the war
of 1536, of which we have spoken more than once,
in which the Bernese took the territory away from
them. Part of it was recovered by Duke Emanuel
Philibert in 1564, and the whole was reassigned by
treaty in 1593. The inhabitants had, in the meantime,
been converted to Protestantism, and the first
task of Savoy was to reconvert them. A mission
for that purpose was led by St. Francis de Sales,
and the principles of the Counter-Reformation
quickly triumphed. The French Revolution
brought a French army to Savoy, but the expelled
rulers came to their own again when the Holy
Alliance resettled the map of Europe. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
further happened until the war which resulted in
the consolidation of a United Italy. Savoy (together
with Nice) was then Napoleon III.'s reward
for ejecting the Austrian garrison from Italian
territory. The country had long been French in
its language and its sympathies, and the people
were quite willing, if not actively anxious, to
change their allegiance; and the history of Savoy
has, since that date, belonged to the history of
France. Its extreme Catholicism, like that of
Brittany, gave trouble at the time of the expulsion
of the Religious Orders, but that is a question of
modern politics into which it is unnecessary to
enter here. We will search instead for the historical
and literary landmarks.</p>

<p>Our first interesting name is that of Duke
Amadeus VIII. The death of his eldest son
caused him profound grief, and 'in 1431,' says
Bishop Creighton, 'he retired from active life,
and built himself a luxurious retreat at Ripaille,
whither he withdrew with seven companions
to lead a life of religious seclusion. His abode
was called the Temple of St. Maurice; he and
his followers wore grey cloaks, like hermits, with
gold crosses round their necks and long staffs
in their hands.' But though Duke Amadeus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dressed as a hermit, he hardly lived as one; and as
for religious seclusion, he interpreted it after a
fashion of his own. 'Vitam magis voluptuosam
quam penitentialem degebat,' is the statement of
his biographer, Æneas Sylvius; and his jovial proceedings
added to the French language the new
expression 'faire Ripaille.'</p>

<p>Those were the days, however, when the Council
of Basle accused Pope Eugenius IV. of heresy and
schism. An Opposition Pope was wanted, and the
Council decided to offer the dignity to the ducal
hermit, who was living a voluptuous rather than a
penitential life. A deputation was sent to wait
upon him at Ripaille. Amadeus, with his hermit
companions, advanced to meet the visitors, with a
cross borne before him, and discussed the proposal
in a thoroughly business-like spirit. 'What,' he
asked, 'do you expect the Pope to live on? I
cannot consume my patrimony and disinherit my
sons.' He was promised a grant of first-fruits of
vacant benefices, and that satisfied him, though he
made the further stipulation that he should not be
required to shave. As a matter of fact, however,
he was presently shamed into shaving by the
respectful amazement of the devout; and he
took the name of Felix V. and entered Basle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
attended by his two sons&mdash;'an unusual escort for
a Pope,' as Creighton justly remarks&mdash;and was
crowned by the Cardinal of Aries, the only Cardinal
present, on July 24, 1440.</p>

<p>The question then arose, Which Pope would be
recognized by the other European Principalities
and Powers? By degrees it was found that the
balance of opinion was against Felix V., and in
favour of Eugenius IV. and his successor Nicolas V.;
and Felix V. then discovered that he did not greatly
care about his somewhat shadowy honours. He
had had much anxiety, and only a small and
irregular stipend. So, on April 7, 1449, he was
persuaded to resign the Papal office, and less than
two years afterwards he died. 'He was more
useful to the Church by his death than by his life,'
says Æneas Sylvius. But that is as it may be.
He was, at all events, an interesting figure and a
better man than Æneas himself, seeing that Æneas,
afterwards Pius II., candidly confessed that he was
'neither holier than David nor wiser than Solomon,'
and actually wrote love-letters to help Sigismund,
Count of Tyrol, 'to overcome the resistance of
a girl who shrank from his dishonourable proposals.'</p>

<small>ST. FRANCIS DE SALES</small></h2>


<p>A greater figure&mdash;perhaps the greatest of all
figures in the history of Savoy&mdash;is that of St.
Francis de Sales. It is a little difficult to speak of
him without appearing to stir the embers of theological
disputation. But the effort must be made,
since he is much too notable a man to be passed
over; and the task may be made easier by the fact
that he is a Catholic of whom Protestants speak
well, even though they have to recognize in him
one of the most damaging of their opponents.
They respect his character even in the act of
examining his propositions; they perceive that it
was just because his character was so admirable
that he was able to do the cause of the Reformation
so much harm.</p>

<p>He combined qualities which, in that age, were
rarely found conjoined, being at once a gentleman
and a scholar, a man of saintly humility, and yet
of energy and courage. Such men were scarce in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
both religious camps. The Reformers had their
share of virile vigour, and the best of them were
among the most learned men of their time; but, on
the whole, they lacked good manners and 'sweet
reasonableness.' Their methods were often violent,
and their speech was often coarse. They upset
altars and smashed stained-glass windows, and threw
sacred images into the rivers, and, as we have seen,
'crowned Roman Catholic priests with cow-dung.'
Their vocabulary, too, was scurrilous, as was natural,
seeing that many of them had risen to eminence in
their church from some very humble rank in life.
They lacked the grand style in theology, and one
could find excuses for calling them vulgarians.</p>

<p>No doubt there was more of the grand style
among their Catholic opponents, but they also fell
short in many ways of the Christian ideal. Many
of them were dissolute debauchees. The case of
Æneas Sylvius, already cited, shows that the most
cynical immorality was not incompatible with the
highest ecclesiastical advancement, and, indeed, it
is notorious that the loose lives of ecclesiastical
dignitaries did more than their unscriptural doctrines
to discredit the Church of Rome and make
the Reformation possible. There were prelates of
whom it could truly be said that they spared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
neither men in their anger nor women in their lust;
and even among those whose reputation was
sweeter, there were a good many who would have
passed a very bad quarter of an hour if haled before
Calvin's Consistory and cross-examined. Even if
they had passed the moral standards, they would
have been found guilty of luxury and arrogance.
They were unduly addicted to purple and fine
linen, and made no pretence to live a simple
life.</p>

<p>On each side, however, there were exceptions,
exempt from the characteristic faults of their
parties, and these, even in that age of vehement
polemics, were able to recognize and appreciate
one another. On the Protestant side there was
M. de Bèze&mdash;the 'gentleman reformer,' as he has
been called&mdash;who, drawing a useful inspiration from
the memories of his unregenerate days, was able to
speak affably with his enemies in the gate. On
the Catholic side there was St. Francis de Sales,
whom the study of the Humane Letters had indeed
humanized, who was transparently sincere, and
who, by the charm of his character, disarmed
antagonism. In an age in which men of all religious
opinions (and of none) lived in daily peril
of torture and the stake, each of these two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
believed that the other was honestly mistaken, and
would have liked to be his friend.</p>

<p>Judged by the historical results of his principal
achievement, St. Francis can hardly escape condemnation
as a maker of mischief and a stirrer-up
of strife. To him, and to him alone, was due the
triumph of the Counter-Reformation in Chablais.
If he had declined that missionary enterprise, or
failed in it, the Duke of Savoy would not have
been encouraged to make the treacherous attempt
upon Genevan independence known as the Escalade.
That plot was actually laid at Thonon, at a
meeting held to celebrate and rejoice over St.
Francis de Sales' apostolic achievements. He must
have known of it; he was in a position to protest
against it; he does not appear to have done anything
of the kind. It went forward, and Spanish
soldiers were hired to cut Genevan throats in the
name of the Church of St. Peter. There we have
cause and effect&mdash;a saintly man interfering with
freedom of thought, and so bringing, not peace, but
a sword.</p>

<p>That is the summing-up of the matter which
impartial logic compels; but, somehow or other, it
does not much interfere with the friendliness of
one's feelings towards St. Francis de Sales. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rude logic of events did not correspond to any
syllogism in his mind. The narrowness of his outlook
was that of his country and his age; the
sweetness of his temper was his own. He loved
his erring brothers, as he considered them, and his
concern was for the salvation of their souls. He
did disinterestedly, and at great personal sacrifice,
the duty which he conceived to lie nearest to him;
he did it like a soldier, who must not reason why,
and with a serene and lofty courage.</p>

<p>The courage of missionaries has often, it is true,
been the subject of exaggerated eulogy. Courage
is no uncommon human quality; and it is doubtful
whether good men are, on an average, any braver
than bad men. It is not only the soldier who, as a
matter of course, takes risks quite equal to those of
the missionary. The brigand, the highwayman,
and the beach-comber, to say nothing of the
terrorist, who is generally an atheist, also do so;
and, these things being so, much of the talk about
the heroism of Christian heroes is almost indecently
vainglorious. Yet, even when all the necessary
deductions have been made, there remains something
singularly fascinating in the courage of
St. Francis de Sales.</p>

<p>He was not by nature pugnacious, as was, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
example, Farel, who took an Irishman's delight in
a row, and considered that it was all in the day's
work when he was fustigated by women, or dragged
up and down the floor of a church by the beard.
His tastes, on the contrary, were refined, and his
inclinations were for the life of the cloister or the
study. He went into the wilds of Chablais&mdash;and
it was really a wild country in those days&mdash;because
he had been called and chosen, and because there
was work to be done there which he was considered
specially capable of doing. Men with guns took
pot-shots at him in the dark places of the forests;
and he once spent a whole winter's night in a
tree-top, while a pack of hungry wolves howled
at him from below. Such adventures were repugnant
to his gentle and sensitive nature; but
he faced them and persevered, year after year,
until at last his pertinacity was rewarded. More
as a tribute to his unique personality than to his
arguments&mdash;which, of course, were only the commonplaces
of Catholic apologetics&mdash;Chablais surrendered
to the Church. Even though one wishes
that Chablais had held out, one cannot help regarding
its evangelist as a sympathetic figure. Pope
Alexander VII. canonized him in 1665.</p>

<small>JOSEPH DE MAISTRE</small></h2>


<p>St. Francis de Sales, was not only a missionary,
but also a man of letters, and&mdash;especially&mdash;a
patron of letters. Thirty years before Richelieu
founded the French Academy, he founded the
Florimontane Academy&mdash;with the motto <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flores
fructusque perennes</i>&mdash;in Savoy, and thus forged
one of the links between the literature of Savoy
and that of France. More than one great writer,
whom we carelessly class as French, was really
of Savoyard origin. Vaugelas, described by Sainte-Beuve
'as the first of our correct and polished
grammarians,' was the son of the Vaugelas who
helped St. Francis de Sales in the formation of
his literary society at Annecy. St. Réal, the
forerunner of Montesquieu, was also a Savoyard;
and so were Count Xavier de Maistre, author of
the widely-read 'Voyage Autour de ma Chambre,'
and Count Joseph de Maistre, his more distinguished
brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph de Maistre, indeed, is the greatest of the
literary sons of Savoy, and a worthy inheritor of the
traditions of the saint, his predecessor. An aristocrat,
and a senator, he was a man of forty when
the revolutionary storm burst upon his country.
For a season he took refuge in Lausanne, where he
often met, and argued with, Madame de Staël,
whom he regarded as a woman with a good heart
but a perverted head. His discussions with her, he
said, 'nearly made the Swiss die with laughing,
though we conducted them without quarrelling.'
Afterwards he was sent to represent his sovereign
at the Court of St. Petersburg, where, he complains,
he had to get on as best he could, 'without a
salary, without a secretary, and without a fur-lined
overcoat.' Both there and at Lausanne he
wrote.</p>

<p>His date and his circumstances class him with
the literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émigrés</i>&mdash;with Madame de Staël,
Châteaubriand, and Sénancour; but he lacks their
melancholy and their sentimentalism. He and
Châteaubriand, indeed, resemble one another as
two champions of the Catholic religion; but they
support that religion from widely different points
of view. Châteaubriand is before all things the
religious æsthete. He deduces the truth of a creed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
from its beauty, and is very little concerned with
its bearing upon moral conduct. Joseph de Maistre,
on the contrary, seems to believe in the authority
of the Church because he believes in authority
generally. He is an Absolutist who hates all
Radicals, and regards the schismatic as the worst
kind of Radical. He makes a religion of the principle
of 'keeping people in their place,' and he supports
his religion with epigrams. The epigrams are very
good, though the religion is very bad. The French,
like the sound critics that they are, have proved
themselves capable of enjoying the one while
refusing to have very much to do with the other.</p>
